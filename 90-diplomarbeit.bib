                   motivated approaches to data analysis in high-dimensional
                   spaces. We consider the case where data are drawn from
                   sampling a probability distribution that has support on or
                   near a submanifold of Euclidean space. We show how to
                   “learn” the homology of the submanifold with high
                   confidence. We discuss an algorithm to do this and provide
                   learning-theoretic complexity bounds. Our bounds are
                   obtained in terms of a condition number that limits the
                   curvature and nearness to self-intersection of the
                   submanifold. We are also able to treat the situation where
                   the data are “noisy” and lie near rather than on the
                   submanifold in question.},
